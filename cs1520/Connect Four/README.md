# Connect Four -- Zhaoyi Ma

**Name:** Zhaoyi Ma

**Pitt ID:** zhm16

#### Assumptions

- The first player plays the first round
- The first player is given the red tokens; the second one has black ones
- The table has a blue border, but cells don't have it (by this way, the game looks more realistic)
- Background and border colors are not pure blue or yellow
- To play the game, click a **column number** to place a token on that column
- The two players can have same name
- To view the **localStorage data correctly**, please press the **refresh/cycling** button in the storage window (**Firefox**), if you use other browsers, please refresh the page **after a new game**
- New game will ask the player names again. One of my classmates talked about this feature with Professor Waits, and he said it is ok to do this.
- If a player makes a Connect Four, then there is no alert for "xxx needs x tokens to win" since it's not necessary
- In local storage, key is the order, value is player name and game time.

#### Installation

- No extra dependencies required to run the game

#### Running the App

- Run "connect4.html"
